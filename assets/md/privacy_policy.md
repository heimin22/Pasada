Thank you for using Pasada! This Privacy Policy describes how Pasada ("we," "us," or "our") collects, uses, and shares information about you when you use our mobile application (the "App").

**1. Information We Collect**

We collect information you provide directly to us, information collected automatically, and information from third parties.

*   **Information You Provide:**
    *   **Account Information:** When you create an account, we collect your email address, display name, and contact number. If you sign up using Google, we receive your name, email address, and profile picture from Google.
    *   **Profile Information:** You may choose to provide an avatar image, which we store.
    *   **Booking Information:** We collect your selected pick-up and drop-off locations (addresses and geographic coordinates) when you book a ride.
    *   **Payment Information:** [**Describe how payment is handled. What processor do you use? What payment info (e.g., partial card numbers, transaction IDs) do you store or have access to?**]
    *   **Communications:** If you contact us directly (e.g., via email for support), we may receive additional information about you.

*   **Information Collected Automatically:**
    *   **Location Information:** With your permission, we collect your precise geographic location (including background location if enabled) using GPS, Wi-Fi, and cellular signals. This is necessary for finding your location, booking rides, tracking jeepneys, and calculating routes/ETAs.
    *   **Usage Information:** We collect information about how you interact with the App, such as features used, ride history, and search queries.
    *   **Device Information:** We may collect information about the mobile device you use to access the App, including hardware model, operating system and version, unique device identifiers, and mobile network information.
    *   **Local Storage:** We store recent search history and selected locations locally on your device using SharedPreferences. We also store booking details locally using a SQLite database for offline access or caching.

*   **Information from Third Parties:**
    *   **Google:** If you sign in with Google, we receive information as described above. We also use Google Maps Platform services (Maps, Places API) which may collect location and usage data according to Google's Privacy Policy.
    *   **Supabase:** We use Supabase for backend services including authentication, database storage (user profiles, booking data), and avatar image storage. Supabase may collect information according to their privacy policy. [**Link to Supabase Privacy Policy**]
    *   **[External ETA Service/Gemini]:** [**Describe the data sent to your ETA prediction service (e.g., anonymized coordinates, time of day) and link to its privacy policy if applicable.**]

**2. How We Use Your Information**

We use the information we collect to:

*   Provide, maintain, and improve the App and its features (e.g., facilitate ride booking, display maps, calculate ETAs).
*   Create and manage your user account and profile.
*   Process payments for rides. [**Adjust based on your payment process**]
*   Communicate with you, including sending service-related messages and responding to support requests.
*   Personalize your experience (e.g., show recent searches).
*   Ensure the security and integrity of our App.
*   Analyze usage patterns to understand how the App is used and identify areas for improvement.
*   Comply with legal obligations.

**3. How We Share Your Information**

We may share your information in the following circumstances:

*   **With Service Providers:** We share information with third-party vendors and service providers who perform services on our behalf, such as:
    *   Supabase (authentication, database, storage)
    *   Google (authentication, mapping services)
    *   [Payment Processor Name] (payment processing)
    *   [External ETA Service Provider] (ETA calculations)
    These providers only have access to the information necessary to perform their functions and are obligated to protect your information.
*   **With Jeepney Drivers:** To facilitate your ride, we may share your pickup location, name, and potentially drop-off location with the assigned driver.
*   **Legal Requirements:** We may disclose your information if required by law, subpoena, or other legal process, or if we believe in good faith that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights, protect your safety or the safety of others, investigate fraud, or respond to a government request.
*   **Business Transfers:** In connection with any merger, sale of company assets, financing, or acquisition of all or a portion of our business by another company, user information may be transferred as part of the transaction.

We do not sell your personal information.

**4. Data Security**

We implement reasonable technical and organizational measures to protect your information from unauthorized access, use, alteration, or destruction. However, no internet transmission or electronic storage is 100% secure.

**5. Data Retention**

We retain your personal information for as long as your account is active or as needed to provide you with the App's services. We may also retain information as required by law or for legitimate business purposes (like resolving disputes or enforcing agreements). Booking details stored locally may persist until the app's cache/data is cleared.

**6. Your Choices and Rights**

*   **Account Information:** You can review and update your account information (display name, email, contact number, avatar) through your profile settings in the App.
*   **Location Permissions:** You can control the App's access to your location information through your device's settings menu. Disabling location access will significantly limit the App's functionality.
*   **Push Notifications:** You can opt-out of receiving push notifications through your device settings.
*   **Google Account:** You can manage the connection between Pasada and your Google account through your Google account settings.
*   **Data Access/Deletion:** Depending on your jurisdiction, you may have rights to access, correct, or delete your personal information. Please contact us at [Your Contact Email] to make such requests. Note that we may need to retain certain information for record-keeping purposes or to complete transactions.
*   **Local Data:** You can clear recent searches within the app [**Verify if this feature exists/is planned**] or clear the app's cache/data through your device settings to remove locally stored information.

**7. Children's Privacy**

The App is not intended for use by children under the age of 13 [**Adjust age if required by local laws, e.g., 16 in some regions**]. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under this age. If we learn we have collected personal information from a child under 13, we will take steps to delete it.

**8. Changes to This Privacy Policy**

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. If we make material changes, we will notify you through the App or by other means before the changes take effect. Your continued use of the App after the effective date constitutes your acceptance of the revised policy.
