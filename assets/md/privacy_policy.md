- Authenticate and manage your user account.

- **Drivers:** To fulfill ride requests, we provide the assigned driver with your name and pickup (and, if necessary, drop-off) location.

We do **not** sell, rent, or trade your personal information for marketing purposes.

We implement administrative, technical, and physical safeguards designed to protect your information against unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure, or destruction. However, no security measure is perfect or impenetrable.



## 5. Data Retention
